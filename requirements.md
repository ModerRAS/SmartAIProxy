# Project Requirements

## Executive Summary

SmartAIProxy is a high-performance, scalable AI API proxy service that supports request forwarding for mainstream AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, etc.). The project involves migrating from a Go implementation to a .NET 9 implementation, enhancing test coverage, and restructuring the repository. The goal is to maintain feature parity while leveraging .NET 9 capabilities and improving overall code quality and test coverage.

## Current State Analysis

### Go Implementation (Original)
- **Structure**: Clean architecture with internal modules
- **Modules**: admin, config, fault, gateway, logger, monitor, provider, router, rule, security
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with test data structure
- **Features**: Advanced routing, fault tolerance, monitoring, JWT/auth
- **Dependencies**: Gin, govaluate, Prometheus, JWT libraries

### .NET Implementation (Current)
- **Structure**: Basic MVC structure with middleware
- **Components**: Basic channel management, rule engine, proxy middleware
- **Testing**: Limited unit tests (2 test files)
- **Features**: Basic proxy functionality, configuration management
- **Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core 9, Serilog, Prometheus, NCalc

## Identified Gaps

### Missing Features in .NET Implementation
1. **Admin Module**: No management API or backend
2. **Fault Tolerance**: No retry mechanism or circuit breaker
3. **Advanced Security**: Limited authentication options
4. **Monitoring**: Basic Prometheus integration, no advanced metrics
5. **Configuration**: No hot-reload capability
6. **Logging**: Basic Serilog setup, no structured logging
7. **Test Coverage**: Only ~20% of Go test coverage

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **Go Implementation**: 11 test files covering all modules
- **.NET Implementation**: 2 test files covering basic functionality
- **Missing Test Categories**: Integration tests, fault tolerance, security, monitoring, admin API
